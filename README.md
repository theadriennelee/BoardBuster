# AngularJS BoardBuster Application


## Description

### Background

This web application is inspired by a business idea where clients can rent popular board games or card games, similar to the concept of BlockBuster. Users will be able to visit the website to browse the catalog or search for specific games. Once a game is chosen, they will be able to select the desired date and then hold the game. Conceptually, the users can visit a physical store to browse games or pick up the games that they have on hold. 

### Features
- Navbar: The navbar allows users to visit all three pages: Home Page, Games Page and Contact Us Page.
- Games Display: By default, when the users first visit the Games Page, it will display all the available games. By using the drop-down menu, the user can choose to display the games by categories: Board Games, Card Games, and Word Games. The user can also search for specific games by entering keywords into the Search Bar. 
- Games Selection: When the users select a game, they will be redirected to a new page where the description of the game will be displayed. If the user decides to rent the game, they will have to select an available date from the provided calendar (bootstrap-datepicker) and their preferred location from the drop-down menu.
- Maps: In the Contact Us Page, the location is shown via Google Maps.
